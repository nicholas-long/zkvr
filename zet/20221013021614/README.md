# zkvr terminal graph browser

- concept of `terminal graph browser`
- zkvr
- text user interface ( TUI ) to follow links
  - interfaced based on workflow from using web browser and github markdown preview to traverse links
  - add and remove links quickly with fzf
  - preview window shows document always, menu picks options, option to visit links
- menu options documentation
  - `goto ...`    - follow link
  - `tab`         - if running in tmux, open multiple other links in new tmux windows (like browser tabs)
  - `mkfile`      - touch a file and optionally `chmod +x`
  - `tagindex`    - browse by tags
  - `workdir`     - open new tmux window in working directory of current card if run within tmux
  - `addtags`     - add multiple tags to card
  - `deltags`     - remove multiple tags from card
  - `spraytag`    - add a tag to multiple links on a card at once. select with fuzzy search.
  - `edit ...`    - edit card or attachments in vim
  - `/search`     - deep keyword search combining links, titles, content, and fzf fuzzy finding. launches new tmux windows if tmux is running.
  - `~`           - return to home page
  - `spawn`       - create a new zettel card linked to here. enter title at prompt. new card is available to navigate and edit immediately.
  - `merge-into`  - merge the content of the current card into a linked card, updating backlinks
  - `autotag`     - use ChatGPT to automatically select tags for the current document
  - `clone`       - copy a template card in, replacing current card. copy entire linked network of cards with tag `#template`. capable of creating large structures of notes.
  - `copy...`     - if running in tmux, select text to copy from snippets with fzf
  - `copyURL`     - if running in tmux, copy the remote github URL to view the current file
  - `copypath`    - if running in tmux, copy the current markdown file path to tmux buffer
  - `xfer`        - copy between cards or attached files easily by selecting files or cards to open alongside `README.md` in vim tabs
  - `fxfer`       - copy files between cards
  - `link`        - insert many links with fzf fuzzy finder
  - `unlink`      - select one link to remove. will remove from target zettel card as well.
  - `stat`        - git status preview, colorized. launches lazygit if selected.
  - `gitlog`      - view git log history of current card and attachments, with paging
  - `diff`        - git diff interactive commit selector
  - `back`        - go back, like a browser
    - if you edit links in cards you are working on, you could get trapped and need to hop back to previous card
  - `fuzz`        - fuzzy find and edit files in tabs alongside the current document
  - `enrich`      - insert backlinks and other various cleanup scripts. runs automatic scripts in cards
    - consider the security implications of automatic scripts
  - `quit`        - exit program. i like q as a hotkey so this is good in fzf.
  - `zkcopy`      - copy cards from other zettelkasten (experimental)
